<h1> "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not just on your own understanding. In all ways submit to him, and he will make your path straight." </h1>

<p> The 356 Group gets its name from the Book of Proverbs 3:5-6. And just as the quote encourages a beautiful relationship of trust between us and the Lord, we too would like to establish a similiar relationship with our customers - one based not on temporary benefits, but on a deep and mutual trust.</p>

<p> Throughout our years of experience, we've come to find that the most successful buisiness partnerships are those based on communication and understanding - and here at the 356 Group, we hold up openness, honesty, and availability as our core three values.</p>

<p> The medical industry can seem almost labyrinthian at times. But here at the 356 Group, you've always got a warm friend by your side.</p>
